force against Germany, however. The British government viewed the occupation of
German territory by German troops as a
reasonable action by a dissatisfied power.
The London Times noted that the Germans
were only “going into their own back garden.” Great Britain thus began to practice
a policy of appeasement. This policy was
based on the belief that if European states
satisfied the reasonable demands of dissatisfied powers, the dissatisfied powers
would be content, and stability and peace
would be achieved in Europe.'

had formed Manchuria into a separate
state and renamed it Manchukuo. They
placed a puppet ruler, Henry Pu Yi, on the
throne. As an infant, Henry Pu Yi had been
China’s “last emperor.” He had abdicated
that throne, however, following the revolution of 1911 in China.'

  context: < 'Japanese leaders had hoped that their
lightning strike at American bases would
destroy the U.S. fleet in the Pacific. The
Roosevelt administration, they thought,
would now accept Japanese domination
of the Pacific. The American people, in
the eyes of Japanese leaders, were soft.
Their easy, rich life had made them unable
to fight. The Japanese miscalculated, however.
The attack on Pearl Harbor unified American opinion about becoming involved in
the war. Once bitterly divided over participating in the war, the American people now
took up arms. The United States joined with
European nations and Nationalist China in
a combined effort to defeat Japan. '

World War II?'

the Crimea, Hitler’s generals wanted him
to concentrate on the Caucasus and its oil
fields. Hitler, however, decided that
Stalingrad, a major industrial center on
the Volga River, should be taken first.
In perhaps the most terrible battle of the
war, between November 1942 and February 2, 1943, the Soviets launched a counterattack. German troops were stopped, then
encircled, and supply lines were cut off, all
in frigid winter conditions. The Germans
were forced to surrender at Stalingrad. The
entire German Sixth Army, considered the
best of the German troops, was lost.'
  question: < 'In what city did Hitler lose his entire German Sixth Army?'

  context: < 'Since the autumn of 1943, the Allies had
planned an invasion of France from Great
Britain, across the English Channel.
Finally, on June 6, 1944 (D-Day), Allied
forces under U.S. general Dwight D.
Eisenhower landed on the Normandy
beaches in history’s greatest naval invasion. The Allies fought their way past
hidden underwater mines, treacherous
barbed wire, and horrible machine gun
fire. Believing the battle was a diversion
and the real invasion would occur elsewhere, the Germans responded slowly.
This gave the Allied forces time to set up
a beachhead. Within three months, the
Allies had landed two million men and
500,000 vehicles. Allied forces then began
pushing inland and broke through German
defensive lines.'
  question: < 'What battle in World War II is considered history’s greatest
naval invasion?'
  answer: 'Normandy'

  context: < 'Reinhard Heydrich, head of the SS’s Security Service, had the task of administering
the Final Solution. Heydrich created special
strike forces, called Einsatzgruppen, to carry
out Nazi plans. After the defeat of Poland,
these forces rounded up all Polish Jews and
put them in ghettos set up in a number of
Polish cities. Conditions in the ghettos were
horrible. Families were crowded together in
unsanitary housing. The Nazis tried to starve
residents by allowing only minimal amounts
of food. In spite of their suffering, residents
carried on, and some organized resistance
against the Nazis.'

war effort. Women and girls worked in
industries, mines, and railroads. Overall,
the number of women working in industry
increased almost 60 percent. Soviet women
were also expected to dig antitank ditches
and work as air-raid wardens. In addition,
the Soviet Union was the only country in
World War II to use women in battle. Soviet
women served as snipers and also in aircrews of bomber squadrons.'
  question: < 'What was the only country in World War II that used women
in battle? '
  answer: 'Soviet Union'

qa:
  context: < 'The search for security during the Cold
War led to the formation of new military
alliances. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed in April 1949
when Belgium, Luxembourg, France, the
Netherlands, Great Britain, Italy, Denmark,
Norway, Portugal, and Iceland signed a
treaty with the United States and Canada.
All the powers agreed to provide mutual
help if any one of them was attacked. A
few years later, West Germany, Turkey, and
Greece also joined.
In 1955 the Soviet Union joined with
Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania
in a formal military alliance known as the
Warsaw Pact. Now, Europe was once again divided into hostile alliance systems, just
as it had been before World War I.'

Castro’s troops.
After the Bay of Pigs, the Soviet Union sent
advisers to Cuba. Then, in 1962, Khrushchev began to place nuclear missiles in
Cuba. The missiles were meant to counteract U.S. nuclear weapons placed in Turkey,
a country within easy range of the Soviet
Union.'

  context: < 'Khrushchev loosened government controls on literary and artistic works. In 1962,
for example, he allowed the publication of
One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. This
novel, written by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
(SOHL•zhuh• NEET•suhn), is a grim
portrayal of life in a Siberian labor camp. Many Soviets identified with Ivan as a symbol of the suffering endured under Stalin.'

  context: < 'Under Adenauer, West Germany experienced an “economic miracle.” This revival
of the West German economy was largely
guided by the minister of finance, Ludwig
Erhard. Unemployment fell from 8 percent
in 1950 to 0.4 percent in 1965. To maintain
its economic expansion, West Germany
even brought in hundreds of thousands of
“guest” workers on visas from other countries such as Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey,
and Yugoslavia.'
  question: < 'Which postwar country experienced an “economic miracle”?'

  context: < 'In the North and West, local patterns of
segregation led to higher unemployment
rates for African Americans than for whites.
In the summer of 1965, race riots broke out
in the Watts district of Los Angeles. Thirtyfour people died and over 1,000 buildings
were destroyed. In 1968 Martin Luther King, Jr., was
assassinated. Riots hit over 100 cities,
including Washington, D.C. The riots led
to a “white backlash” (whites became less
sympathetic to the cause of racial equality)
and continued the racial division of the
United States'

  context: < 'Of great importance to the emergence of the postwar
women’s liberation movement was the work of Simone
de Beauvoir (duh•boh•VWAHR). In 1949 she published
The Second Sex. As a result of male-dominated societies,
she argued, women were defined by their differences from
men and consequently received second-class status. De
Beauvoir influenced both the American and European
women’s movements.'
